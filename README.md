# Spam Classification with Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to classify online content (such as messages, emails, and reviews) as spam or not spam. The model is trained using the "SMS Spam Collection" dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model to identify spam content. The project involves:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using various metrics
- Classification of new content

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "SMS Spam Collection" dataset, which contains labeled examples of spam and non-spam messages.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-classification.git
   cd spam-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training:**
   Run the `train_model.py` script to preprocess the data, extract features, and train the model.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Model Inference:**
   Use the trained model to classify new messages. Run the `classify_message.py` script with a sample message.
   ```bash
   python classify_message.py "Your sample message here"
   ```

### Example
```python
# Example usage in classify_message.py script
new_message = "Congratulations! You've won a free ticket to Bahamas. Call now!"
classification = classify_message(new_message)
print(f"The message is classified as: {classification}")
```

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

Results are printed at the end of the `train_model.py` script.
